## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that in the future if you need to recall a specific version you can.
2. Git grew from the fall out between Linux Kernel and a commercial company behind the making of BitKeeper. 
3. There are two ways to acquire a Git project the first is to acquire an existing project and import it into Git and the second clones an existing Git repository from another server.
