            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that in the future if you need to recall a specific version you can. A Version Control System or VCS is a very helpful thing to have. It allows you to revert a file back to its previous state, revert an entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that could be causing a problem, when the problem was introduced and by who, and more. It is interesting to know that something was created to help with keeping all your files intact. This topic is relevant because there may come a time when we need to revisit files to see what steps were taken during the process of a project.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git grew from the fall out between Linux Kernel and a commercial company behind the making of BitKeeper. From the breakdown Linux would develop a tool that holds lessons learned from working with BitKeeper. Git would have new goals such as speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. Git is an interesting topic because it is made up of two previous companies that wasn’t able to keep themselves going. The fact that they were able to take a little bit from both companies and create a system that was better than before is good to read about. It’s relevant to our course because we see that things are changing every day and we have the tools to create systems that are better, faster, and stronger.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different from other Version Control Systems. Git thinks about the data while other systems think of information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. Git sees the data as a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystems, every time you save or commit Git takes a picture of what the file looks like. Some other things about Git is most operations only need the local files and resources to operate and it’s impossible to change the contents of any files without Git knowing. The thought of having a system that holds all of your files from the start of a project to the end is interesting. It is able to capture all the changes made no matter how small. It is relevant because when working with others it allows for projects to get done more efficiently, you can see when someone came in and may have messed up which allows the group to work together and explain the solution.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to acquire a Git project the first is to acquire an existing project and import it into Git and the second clones an existing Git repository from another server. When it comes to cloning, you don’t just receive a working copy of your repository. Using the command git clone you get a full copy of nearly all data the server has, every version of every file for the history of the project. This system is definitely helpful and makes it easy when it comes to acquiring a repository. It is relevant to our course because we have to learn the difference between the repositories and what will take place between them as well.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in a working directory can be in two states tracked or untracked. Tracked files can be unmodified, modified, or staged they are from the last snapshot and untracked files are everything else they are the files that are not in the staging area or in your working directory and did not come from your last snapshot. When you edit files Git will record them as modified, you then stage them and once you commit your files the cycle repeats. When looking at this process it seems that they tried to make it as simple as they can by only making two states in a working directory. It is relevant to the course because it reminds to make sure you are saving your assignments and rechecking your files.</p>
